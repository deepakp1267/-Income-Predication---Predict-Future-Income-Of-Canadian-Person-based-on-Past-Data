# Predicting Canada's Per Capita Income and Cost Value using Linear Regression

This project involves predicting Canada's per capita income for the year 2020 using linear regression. The dataset contains historical income data from 1970 to 2016. Key steps and components of the project include:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Importing required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
   - Creating a DataFrame with years and income data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Checking for income values greater than 5000.
   - Descriptive statistics, data samples, and data information.
   - Filtering data for income > 25000 and years > 2010.
   - Visualizing data with scatter plots and a reference line.
   - Adding a new data point and sorting data by income.

3. **Linear Regression Modeling:**
   - Building a linear regression model using scikit-learn.
   - Fitting the model to the data.
   - Predicting income for a specific year (2022).
   - Extracting model coefficients and intercept.

4. **Visualization and Saving Results:**
   - Plotting the original data and predicted values.
   - Adding predicted values to the DataFrame.
   - Saving the DataFrame to a CSV file.

5. **Gradient Descent Algorithm (Bonus):**
   - Implementing gradient descent for linear regression.
   - Iteratively updating model parameters to minimize the cost function.
   - Visualizing the original data and predicted values using gradient descent.

6. **GitHub README Summary:**
   - Predicted Canada's per capita income for 2020 using linear regression.
   - Visualized data using scatter plots and reference lines.
   - Implemented gradient descent algorithm for linear regression (bonus).
   - Included exploratory data analysis, model fitting, and visualization steps.
   - Saved predicted values and relevant data to a CSV file.
